===== Procedure =====

==== Step1 ====
Configuration
(How To Back Up a CentOS 7 Server with Bacula, DigitalOcean n.d.)
Bacula Director
Make a backup copy of the original configuration files located at /etc/bacula
mv /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf /etc/bacula/bak/bacula-dir.bak
cp /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf /etc/bacula/bak/bacula-sd.bak
cp /etc/bacula/bacula-fd.conf /etc/bacula/bal/bacula-fd.bak
Create the main configuration file located at /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
sudo vi /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
Director Resource Configuration
Add the following to the file
# Define this director
Director {                          
   Name = bacula-dir
   # where we listen for UA connections
   DIRport = 9101                
   QueryFile = "/etc/bacula/query.sql"
   WorkingDirectory = "/var/spool/bacula"
   PidDirectory = "/var/run"
   Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
   # Chose a safe console password  
   Password = "CorrectBatteryHorseStaple"         
   Messages = Daemon
   # This is the address to listen on, configure it to localhost
   DirAddress = 127.0.0.1
}
#
# Restricted console used by tray-monitor to get the status of the director
#
Console {
   Name = bacula-mon
   Password = "CorrectBatteryHorseStaple"
   CommandACL = status, .status
}
At the end of the file add the following line to ensure Bacula loads our custom configuration directory
@|"find /etc/bacula -name '*.conf' -type f -exec echo @{} \;"
Storage Daemon Resource
Create the storage daemon configuration file located at /etc/bacula/storage.conf
sudo vi /etc/bacula/storage.conf
Add the following to the file
Storage {
   Name = File
   # Do not use "localhost" here or clients cant connect
   # use a fqdn or IP address
   Address = bacula_director_fqdn_or_ip                
   # Configure access port for the Storage Daemon
   SDPort = 9103
   # Bacula Password
   Password = "CorrectBatteryHorseStaple"
   # Type of storage device
   Device = FileStorage
   # Result of backup
   Media Type = File
}
Local Backup Configuration
Create the local backup configuration file located at /etc/bacula/job.conf
sudo vi /etc/bacula/job.conf
Add the following to the file
Job {
   Name = "BackupLocalFiles"
   JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
}
Database Connection
Create the database configuration file located at /etc/bacula/catalog.conf
sudo vi /etc/bacula/catalog .conf
Add the following to the file
# Generic catalog service
Catalog {
   Name = MyCatalog
   dbname = "bacula";
   dbuser = "bacula";
   dbpassword = "CorrectBatteryHorseStaple"
}
Messaging
To configure the backup schedules create a file called /etc/bacula/msg.conf
vi /etc/bacula/msg.conf
add the following to suit the requirement
# Reasonable message delivery -- send most everything to email address and console
Messages {
   Name = Standard
   mailcommand = "/usr/sbin/bsmtp -h localhost -f \"\(Bacula\) \<%r\>\"   	      -s \"Bacula: %t %e of %c %l\" %r"
   operatorcommand = "/usr/sbin/bsmtp -h localhost -f \"\(Bacula\) \<%r\>\" -s \"Bacula: Intervention needed for %j\" %r"
   mail = root@localhost = all, !skipped            
   operator = root@localhost = mount
   console = all, !skipped, !saved
   append = "/var/log/bacula/bacula.log" = all, !skipped
   catalog = all
}
#
# Message delivery for daemon message pool = Default 
Messages = Standard 
Where = /bacula/restore 
# ETC Backup Template 
Job { 
   # Each job must have a unique name 
   Name = "backupETC-bacula" 
   Type = Backup 
   Client = bacula 
   FileSet = "ETC" 
   Storage = File 
   # Set the schedule to one of the predefined schedules on the Director 
   Schedule = "BusinessData" 
   Messages = Standard 
   Pool = Default 
   # Define Pools for each backup type 
   Full Backup Pool =Default 
   Incremental Backup Pool = Default 
   Differential Backup Pool = Default 
   # Some jobs are more important than others 
   Priority=5 
   Where = /bacula/backup 
} 
# WWW Restore template. 
Job { 
   Name = "RestoreETC-bacula" 
   Type = Restore 
   Client=bacula 
   FileSet="ETC" 
   Storage = File 
   Pool = Default 
   Messages = Standard 
   Where = /bacula/restore 
}
Messages {
   Name = Daemon
   mailcommand = "/usr/sbin/bsmtp -h localhost -f \"\(Bacula\) \<%r\>\" -s \"Bacula      daemon message\" %r"
   mail = root@localhost = all, !skipped            
   console = all, !skipped, !saved
   append = "/var/log/bacula/bacula.log" = all, !skipped
}
Schedules
To configure the backup schedules create a file called /etc/bacula/schedule.conf
vi /etc/bacula/schedule.conf
add the following to suit the requirements
Schedule {
   Name = "BusinessData"
   Run = Level=Full Pool=Full-Pool 1st mon at 18:00
   Run = Level=Differential Pool=Differential-Pool mon at 18:00
   # Run an incremental backup every 3 hours and 30 minutes
   Run = Level=Incremental Pool=Incremental-Pool mon-fri at 08:00
   Run = Level=Incremental Pool=Incremental-Pool mon-fri at 11:30
   Run = Level=Incremental Pool=Incremental-Pool mon-fri at 15:00
}
Job Definitions
To configure the backup schedules create a file called /etc/bacula/jobdefs.conf
vi /etc/bacula/jobdefs.conf
add the following to suit the requirements
JobDefs {
  Name = "DefaultJob"
  Type = Backup
  Level = Incremental
  Client = bacula-fd 
  FileSet = "Full Set"
  Schedule = "WeeklyCycle"
  Storage = File
  Messages = Standard
  Pool = File
  Priority = 10
  Write Bootstrap = "/var/spool/bacula/%c.bsr"
}
Storage Pools
To configure the storage pool options that define job retention and backup rules create a file called /etc/bacula/pools.conf
vi /etc/bacula/pools.conf
add the following to suit the requirements
# Storage Pool definition
Pool {
   Name = Default
   Pool Type = Backup
   # Bacula can automatically recycle Volumes  	
   Recycle = yes
   # Remove expired backup files                       
   AutoPrune = yes
   # Time to retain backup for                     
   Volume Retention = 365 days
   # Set the maximum size for backup files
   Maximum Volume Bytes = 50G
   # Set maximum number of backups          
   Maximum Volumes = 100         
}
Pool {
   Name = Full-Pool
   Pool Type = Backup
   # Automatically recycle volumes
   Recycle = yes
   # Prune expired volumes
   AutoPrune = yes
   Volume Retention = 6 months
   Maximum Volume Jobs = 1
   Label Format = "Monthly-Full-${Year}-${Month:p/2/0/r}-${Day:p/2/0/r}-${Hour:p/2/0/r}-${Minute:p/2/0/r}" 
   Maximum Volumes = 6
}
Pool {
   Name = Incremental-Pool
   Pool Type = Backup
   Recycle = yes
   AutoPrune = yes
   Volume Retention = 1 month
   Maximum Volume Jobs = 1
   Label Format = "Weekly-Inc-${Year}-${Month:p/2/0/r}-${Day:p/2/0/r}-${Hour:p/2/0/r}-${Minute:p/2/0/r}" 
   Maximum Volumes = 4
}
Pool {
   Name = Differential-Pool
   Pool Type = Backup
   Recycle = yes
   AutoPrune = yes
   Volume Retention = 14 days
   Maximum Volume Jobs = 1
   Label Format = "Daily-Diff-${Year}-${Month:p/2/0/r}-${Day:p/2/0/r}-${Hour:p/2/0/r}-${Minute:p/2/0/r}" 
   Maximum Volumes = 7
}
File Selection
To define the files and directories to be included in each backup create a file called /etc/bacula//fileset.conf
vi /etc/bacula/fileset.conf
add the following to suit the requirements
# List of files to be backed up
FileSet {
   # Name your fileset
   Name = "Full Set"
   Include {
		# Put file set backup options here
		Options {
	 	signature = MD5
	 	compression = GZIP
	 }    
	 # Put file's and directories to backup here. Note that partitions 		 # existing on the file system need to be added individually. 
	 File = /etc
   }
   	 # Put file's and directories to ignore here
		Exclude {
	 	File = /var/lib/bacula
	 	File = /proc
	 	File = /tmp
   }
}
Create a separate ‘fileset’ definition for each client that has specific backup requirements. Save the file and exit
Add Clients 
Create a file called /etc/bacula/conf/ClientName.conf for each client that requires backup services
vi /etc/bacula/conf/ClientName.conf
add the following to suit the requirements
Client {
   Name = ClientHost-fd
   Address = client_private_FQDN
   # Can be changed in the client’s bacula-fd.conf file if required
   FDPort = 9102 
   Catalog = MyCatalog
   # This is the password entered into each client’s bacula-fd.conf file
   Password = "CorrectBatteryHorseStaple"          
   File Retention = 30 days            
   Job Retention = 6 months            
   AutoPrune = no                     
}
# Define backup jobs here
Job {
   # Each job must have a unique name
   Name = "fullbackup-ClientName"
   Client=ClientName-fd
   JobDefs = “DefaultJob”
   FileSet="AppropriateFileset"
   FileSet = "Full Set"
   Storage = localhost-sd
   # Set the schedule to one of the predefined schedules on the Director
   Schedule = "BusinessData"
   Messages = Standard
   Pool = Default
   # Define Pools for each backup type
   Full Backup Pool = Full-Pool
   Incremental Backup Pool = Inc-Pool
   Differential Backup Pool = Diff-Pool
   # Some jobs are more important than others
   Priority=5
}
Bacula Storage Daemon
Open the main configuration file
sudo vi /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
Move to the ‘Storage’ section and configure the connection to the Bacula Director
Storage {                            
   Name = BackupServer-sd
   # Port assigned on Director
   SDPort = 9103                  
   WorkingDirectory = "/var/lib/bacula"
   Pid Directory = "/var/run/bacula"
   Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20
   # FQDN assigned on Director
   SDAddress = backup_server_private_FQDN
}
Move to the ‘Device’ section and configure the Backup Directory Location
Device {
   Name = FileStorage
   Media Type = File
   Archive Device = /bacula/backup 
   LabelMedia = yes;                   
   Random Access = Yes;
   AutomaticMount = yes;               
   RemovableMedia = no;
   AlwaysOpen = no;
}
Check Configuration Syntax
Perform a dry run to test configuration
sudo bacula-dir -tc /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
sudo bacula-sd -tc /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
(Re)Start the Bacula Director Service and ensure it is enabled at system boot
sudo systemctl restart bacula-dir 
sudo systemctl enable bacula-dir
MariaDB
Start MariaDB and enable on boot
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
Create Bacula user, database and tables
/usr/libexec/bacula/grant_mysql_privileges
/usr/libexec/bacula/create_mysql_database -u root
/usr/libexec/bacula/make_mysql_tables -u bacula
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Create Bacula password
mysql -u root -p
At the MariaDB prompt enter the following
UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('CorrectBatteryHorseStaple') WHERE User='bacula';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
To enable MariaDB support run the following
sudo alternatives --config libbaccats.so
Enter the following at the prompted
There are 3 programs which provide 'libbaccats.so'.
